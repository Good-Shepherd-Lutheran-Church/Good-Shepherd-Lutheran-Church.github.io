		text="GSLS believes that the way the child feels about himself and the way
  they dress directly influences their attitude about school. Since school can be thought of as the
  child’s workplace, the way he or she dresses should reflect this philosophy. The School Board
  has adopted an official school uniform. All students in grades K-5 will wear their uniforms
  except on special days that will be specified. Our school uniform offers students several choices
  in the form of colors and styles of clothing, while providing consistency, neatness, safety and a
  sense of modesty. We want to dress our best out of respect for our Lord."

  sweatshirts or cardigans, which can be ordered through the school. If purchasing outside of
  GSLS, these items should be khaki or navy. A white blouse or shirt may be worn. Socks or tights
  must be worn in solid colors; white, khaki, or navy. Leather shoes or athletic style sneakers are
  acceptable. The school requires the purchase of at least one polo shirt with the school’s logo
  on it from the school."

		<li>
			Our school values the worth and dignity of every person, the pursuit of truth, devotion to
			excellence, acquisition of knowledge, and the nurture of democratic citizenship. Essential to
			the achievement of these standards are the freedom to learn and to teach and the guarantee of
			equal opportunity for all.
		</li>
		<li>
			Our primary concern is the student and the development of the student&#39;s potential.
			Employees will therefore strive for professional growth and will seek to exercise the best
			professional judgment and integrity.
		</li>
		<li><p>Concern for the student requires that our instructional personnel:</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Shall make reasonable effort to protect the student from conditions harmful to learning
				and/or to the student&#39;s mental and/or physical health and/or safety.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Shall not unreasonably restrain a student from independent action in pursuit of learning.
		</li>
		<li>Shall not unreasonably deny a student access to diverse points of view.</li>
		<li>
			Shall not intentionally suppress or distort subject matter relevant to a student&#39;s
			academic program.
		</li>
		<li>Shall not intentionally expose a student to unnecessary embarrassment or disparagement.</li>
		<li>Shall not intentionally violate or deny a student&#39;s legal rights.</li>
		<li>
			Shall not harass or discriminate against any student on the basis of race, color, religion,
			sex, age, national or ethnic origin, political beliefs, marital status, handicapping
			condition, sexual orientation, or social and family background and shall make reasonable
			effort to assure that each student is protected from harassment or discrimination.
		</li>
		<li>Shall not exploit a relationship with a student for personal gain or advantage.</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Shall keep in confidence personally identifiable information obtained in the course of
				professional service, unless disclosure serves professional purposes or is required by law.

		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Aware of the importance of maintaining the respect and confidence of colleagues, of
				students, of parents, and of the community, employees of our school must display the highest
				degree of ethical conduct. This commitment requires that our employees:
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Shall maintain honesty in all professional dealings.</p></li>
		<li>
			Shall not on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national or ethnic origin,
			political beliefs, marital status, handicapping condition if otherwise qualified, or social
			and family background deny to a colleague professional benefits or advantages or participation
			in any professional organization.
		</li>
		<li>
			Shall not interfere with a colleague&#39;s exercise of political or civil rights and
			responsibilities.
		</li>
		<li>
			Shall not engage in harassment or discriminatory conduct which unreasonably interferes with an
			individual&#39;s performance of professional or work responsibilities or with the orderly
			processes of education or which creates a hostile, intimidating, abusive, offensive, or
			oppressive environment; and, further, shall make reasonable effort to assure that each
			individual is protected from such harassment or discrimination.

		<li>Shall not make malicious or intentionally false statements about a colleague.</li>

		<strong>Reporting Misconduct by Instructional Personnel and Administrators</strong> All
		employees, educational support employees, and administrators have an obligation to report
		misconduct by instructional personnel and school administrators, which affects the health,
		safety, or welfare of a student. Examples of misconduct include obscene language, drug and
		alcohol use, disparaging comments, prejudice or bigotry, sexual innuendo, cheating or testing
		violations, physical aggression, and accepting or offering favors. Reports of misconduct of
		employees should be made to Holly Garrett, Administrator at 850-932-9127 or 850-934-6959.
		Reports of misconduct committed by administrators should be made to Heather McEachern, Director
		at 850-932-9127. Legally sufficient allegations of misconduct by Florida certified educators
		will be reported to the Office of Professional Practices Services. Policies and procedures for
		reporting misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators which affects the
		health, safety, or welfare of a student are posted in the
		<strong>hallway near the water fountains and on the kitchen refrigerator</strong> and on our Web
		site at:
	</p>
	<p><strong>goodshepherdgb.com.</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>Reporting Child Abuse, Abandonment or Neglect</strong> All employees and agents have an
		affirmative duty to report all actual or suspected cases of child abuse, abandonment, or
		neglect. Call 1-800- 96-ABUSE or report online at:
		<a href="http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/abuse/report/">http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/abuse/report/</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Signs of Physical Abuse The child may have unexplained bruises, welts, cuts, or other injuries;
		broken bones; or burns. A child experiencing physical abuse may seem withdrawn or depressed,
		seem afraid to go home or may run away, shy away from physical contact, be aggressive, or wear
		inappropriate clothing to hide injuries.
	</p>
	<p>
		Signs of Sexual Abuse The child may have torn, stained or bloody underwear, trouble walking or
		sitting, pain or itching in genital area, or a sexually transmitted disease. A child
		experiencing sexual abuse may have unusual knowledge of sex or act seductively, fear a
		particular person, seem withdrawn or depressed, gain or lose weight suddenly, shy away from
		physical contact, or run away from home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Signs of Neglect The child may have unattended medical needs, little or no supervision at home,
		poor hygiene, or appear underweight. A child experiencing neglect may be frequently tired or
		hungry, steal food, or appear overly needy for adult attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		Patterns of Abuse: Serious abuse usually involves a combination of factors. While a single sign
		may not be significant, a pattern of physical or behavioral signs is a serious indicator and
		should be reported.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Liability Protections</strong> Liability Protections Any person, official, or institution
		participating in good faith in any act authorized or required by law, or reporting in good faith
		any instance of child abuse, abandonment, or neglect to the department or any law enforcement agency,
		shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which might otherwise result by reason of such
		action. (F.S. 39.203)
	</p>
	<p>
		An employer who discloses information about a former or current employee to a prospective
		employer of the former or current employee upon request of the prospective employer or of the
		former or current employee is immune from civil liability for such disclosure or its
		consequences unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the information disclosed
		by the former or current employer was knowingly false or violated any civil right of the former
		or current employee protected under F.S. Chapter 760. (F.S. 768.095)
